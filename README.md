## Installation
> **Note:** OpenHack is only compatible with Windows (also Linux and macOS, if you're using Proton/Wine to run Geometry Dash). Other operating systems are not supported for now.

There are two ways to install OpenHack: using Geode, or manually installing the mod. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, so choose the one that best suits your needs.

### Geode
1. Find "OpenHack" in the Geode mod list.
2. Click the "Install" button to install the mod.
3. Restart the game, and press "Tab" to open the mod menu.

You can also install the mod manually by downloading the latest `.geode` release from the [releases](https://github.com/prevter/gdopenhack/releases) page.

### Vanilla
1. Download the latest `.zip` release from the [releases](https://github.com/prevter/gdopenhack/releases) page.
2. Extract everything from the `.zip` file to your Geometry Dash folder. (Right click on Geometry Dash in your Steam library, and select "Manage" -> "Browse local files")
3. Run the game, and press "Tab" to open the mod menu.

### Extra steps for Linux
If you're using Linux, in addition to the above steps, you'll need to add startup parameters to the game's launch options. 
To do this, right-click on Geometry Dash in your Steam library, click "Properties", and then enter following parameters to the launch options:
```sh
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="xinput9_1_0=n,b" %command%
```
After that, you should be able to run the game and use the mod as usual.

## Building
### Prerequisites
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Install the "Desktop development with C++" workload)
- [Geode CLI](https://docs.geode-sdk.org/getting-started/geode-cli) (optional, for building the Geode mod)

### Instructions
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/prevter/gdopenhack --recursive
cd gdopenhack
```

> Next steps can be done using the command line or using CMake build tools for VSCode.

Build using CLI:
```sh
cmake -B build -A Win32 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo
```

Build using CMake Tools for VSCode:
1. Open the project in VSCode.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select "CMake: Select a Kit".
3. Choose the "Visual Studio Community 2022 Release - x86" or "Visual Studio Community 2022 Release - amd64_x86" kit.
4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select "CMake: Build".

This will build both the Geode and vanilla versions of the mod.

The built mod will be located in the `bin` folder.
(If you're building the Geode mod, the `.geode` file will be installed automatically to your game's mods folder.)
